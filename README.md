# Ami Asaf Group 1's Skillz 2018 Competition code 

Along the course of a month, Tomer Gross and I built this bot, a bot that eventually got into the top 8 (out of the 270) of SkillZ 2018. 
When we started to work on the bot we had one major goal in mind; to make it as generic as possible so it would be able to handle everything that will be thrown it's way. The strategy is split into tasks, each turn a pirate is assigned the optiomal task for it, 
that means that pirates may change their role each and every turn if that will benefit us (this should not happen, but is technically possible).
