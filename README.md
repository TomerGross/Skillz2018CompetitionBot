# Ami Asaf Group 1's Skillz 2018 Competition code 

Together with Tomer Gross, we built this bot with the goal of making it as generic as possible.
The strategy is split into tasks, each turn a pirate is assigned the optiomal task for it, 
that means that pirates may change their role each and every turn if that will benefit us (this should not happen, but is technically possible).
